## A Friday to remember at the Hard Rock Café

What an incredible evening we had last Friday at the Hard Rock Café!

Despite some small technological misfortunes (including Kry's poor cell phone, which decided to abandon us right at the moment), the concert was a real success.

## Tribute to The Cranberries
The place was full, the atmosphere was very warm and the audience was attentive, involved and full of energy, making everything even more special.

It was wonderful to see so many people singing along with us.

## The lineup
From Zombie to Animal instinct to Daffodil Lament we shared emotions and vibrations that only the music of The Cranberries can create.


## Save the date: We return to the Hard Rock café in Milan for St. Patrick's Day 2026!
And the good news doesn't end there: Hard Rock Café Milano has invited us again!

We will be back on March 17th to celebrate St. Patrick's Day together, with a special line-up designed specifically for the occasion.



Mark the date on your calendar — it will be another night to experience and remember together thanks to the music of The Cranberries!
