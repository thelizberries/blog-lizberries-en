## January concerts: our journey into feelings to the tune of The Cranberries
There are evenings that remain imprinted not only for the music, but for the energy that arises spontaneously between stage and audience.

This was the case for our mini-tour in January, in which three concerts turned into a real emotional journey.

## The Shamrock Pub in Lecco: our favorite place to remember Dolores O'Riordan

The first stop was at **The Shamrock Pub in Lecco**, an intimate venue with an authentically Irish flavour.

A pub where **we really feel at home **and where, for the eighth time since her passing, we **remembered our Dolores.**


### January 15th: a special date to pay homage to The Cranberries


**January 15** is a painful date for those who loved her, and the best way to keep her alive is to sing her most beautiful songs.

This is exactly what happened that evening: **an extraordinary and very loyal audience** sang with us, as if we were all united by an invisible thread made of memories, emotions and shared love.

## Pogue Mahone's in Milan: singing The Cranberries among friends
The next day, **Pogue Mahone's in Milan** welcomed us with a different but equally intense atmosphere: more folk, more communal. The rustic setting, the warm lights and the stage that looks like a living room create **the feeling of being among friends**, gathered to listen to music that comes from the heart.


### Warmth and participation: they made us feel at home


It was our first time there, but** the welcome was immediately warm**, almost as if we were old friends. A special thanks to **<a href="https://andrearock.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline;">Andrea Rock</a>**, who not only invited us, but organized **everything to perfection**.

From the first chord onwards, the magic started immediately: an enthusiastic and involved audience overwhelmed us with its energy.
## Teatro Guanella in Milan: a tour in Ireland with the music of The Cranberries
The conclusion of this journey was at the **Teatro Guanella in Milan** with the show *On the Trail of the Cranberries*, a concert that turned into **shared story and journey**.

Here we didn't just play: we really accompanied the audience to Ireland, crossing cities, places and emotions linked to the history of the Cranberries — **from Dublin to Cork, up to Limerick.**

### Ode to My Family and Zombie: the depth of the songs in the theatrical story

The theatrical setting gave a new depth to the songs: **Ode to My Family **and **Zombie** were not simple live performances, but real **monuments of memory and feeling**.

The audience allowed themselves to be led on this journey full of emotions, also thanks to our talented narrator** Daniela Casella**, who between one song and another was able to tell, with an intense and engaging voice, what we experienced during the last tour in the Cranberries' locations.

## Three evenings, a single common thread: the eternal legacy of The Cranberries
Three different evenings, three places united by **a single common thread: the music of The Cranberries**, respected and reinterpreted with our hearts by us **The Lizberries**.
Whether it was a crowded pub or a crowded theatre, the feeling was always the same: being part of something that goes beyond the concert.

## Beyond the concert: a unique bond

An emotional journey made of memories, eternal notes and human connections, to remember the one who was the voice of all this and who continues to sing inside us: Dolores.

What is the song that excites you the most and connects you to Dolores?
