## A pleasant and unexpected engagement: the most beautiful songs by The Cranberries in Sauze d'Oulx
This time it all happened very quickly, almost by chance


<!--more-->

«Are you free on Friday for a concert at the Miravallino in Sauze d'Oulx?»

«Yes, we are free and available.»

«Then we would really like to hear from you with the music of the Cranberries, we are waiting for you!»
Ok, done.
## Miravallino welcomes fans from all over Europe to sing The Cranberries
And so, in a very short time, we organized our trip to the bottom of the **Val di Susa**, on the border with France.

The **Miravallino** venue welcomed us with all the typical warmth of a high mountain pub, perfect for live music.

But the real surprise came immediately afterwards: people from **all over Europe** – Italy, England, Belgium, Denmark and beyond – were singing at the top of their lungs and dancing to the tune of **The Cranberries**.
## From Zombie to Promises The Lizberries and the audience merge into one voice
For a moment we almost believed we had returned to Ireland, the country where this music, for obvious reasons, is experienced in a special way.

And yet we were there, having fun with the audience and in the audience. The stage, small and intimate, did not slow down the explosion of energy in the slightest on songs like ***Zombie, Dreams, Promises***... everyone was singing, clapping and warming up the atmosphere of a cold and snowy winter evening.
## Casa-elé pampers us after an emotional tribute to The Cranberries
It was really lovely.

We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for this wonderful experience, which ended with a night in an equally special apartment: Casa - elé in Exilles, which welcomed us with warmth and intimacy, almost as if it were a fairytale house. What more could you want?
## Don't miss our acoustic session at Pogue Mahone's
But let's not stop warming these cold nights.
We are waiting for you on Monday 9 February for an **intimate acoustic session** at** Pogue Mahone's** in Milan: no electricity, no artificial constructions.

Mattia's guitar, Cristina's voice and the voice of the audience around a table, like in real Irish pubs.

To warm vocal cords and hearts, while the cold hits outside and the rain beats on the windows.🍀🎶
