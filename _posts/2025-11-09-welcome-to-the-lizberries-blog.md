## Who we are
We are the Lizberries, a group of friends and musicians who created a tribute band dedicated to The Cranberries in 2010.

Their music is our inspiration and we love bringing it to the stage with respect and passion.

## What you will find in our blog
We have decided to open this small online space to share with you what we are passionate about.

Here you will find:
- 🎶 behind the scenes of our projects
- 📝 stories, thoughts and inspirations
- 📸 photos and moments that never end up on Instagram
- 💡 ideas, advice and some surprises

## A corner for everyone
It will be like an open diary: a place to tell us without filters and where you can leave comments, questions or even just a greeting.

## Stay updated:
If you're curious to find out what's cooking, stay with us: soon we will publish the first update on [a project/a song/something of yours].

Thanks for being here 💜
The Lizberries
