## A break in December to recharge your batteries

<!--more-->


In December we took a break to recover our energy.
This month, often full of personal commitments, is the ideal time to dedicate time to families and recharge your batteries. However, The Cranberries' music will return very soon with new emotions and new live dates.

## Return to the stage: January 17th at the Teatro Guanella in Milan
The first big event of 2026 will be the live show on January 17th, at 9pm, at the Teatro Guanella in Milan. It will be a show dedicated to our summer tour in Ireland, with a musical story that retraces places, meetings and episodes linked to The Cranberries.

What we will tell during the show:

- Emotions experienced in the band's symbolic places
- Meetings with people linked to the history of The Cranberries
- Special moments from our Irish tour
- Anecdotes and memories related to music and Dolores


The show will be an emotional journey, open to those who love Irish rock and fans of The Cranberries tribute.
