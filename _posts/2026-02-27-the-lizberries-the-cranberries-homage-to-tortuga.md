## Let's Go Home: The Lizberries with The Cranberries at the Tortuga Pub
Tonight we return to play in one of our historic venues.
<!--more-->
**One of the first who believed in us** when we started performing as Lizberries.

And every time we set foot in there again it's a bit like coming home. We can't wait!
## The atmosphere we love: the emotion of singing Dolores O'Riordan songs with our most loyal fans
We already know that under that stage we will find our very loyal fans: those who write to us throughout the year, who ask us "When are you coming back to Tortuga?", and who are always there, very punctual, **ready to sing and dance to the notes of The Cranberries** with the same energy as the first time.

And then there is Davide. Our friend and historic manager.**The captain.**

Because yes, we talked about ships... and that's not a figure of speech.
## The Tortuga Pub: A unique place inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean
The Tortuga is truly **Jack Sparrow's** ship.

The furnishings are completely pirate-like, with wood, ropes, maritime details and that atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in the middle of the Caribbean. And going on stage? It's an adventure every time.

As soon as the **Pirates of the Caribbean** music starts, the band must "run" behind the bar, push through the crew and conquer the stage - our ship.

From then on we really set sail: we guide the crew amidst intense emotions, singing at the top of our lungs and pure fun.
## A special memory: The concert on February 29, 2020
And then there is an anecdote that we Lizberries carry in our hearts. In 2020 Tortuga had given us a truly special Saturday night. One of those who think: "A date like this will never happen again."

It was February 29, 2020. **A very rare date**. A Saturday that only happens every twenty-eight years. But on February 21st they closed everything due to Covid. Stop.

But tonight we set sail again. Crew… are you ready?

The bond that unites us at the Tortuga Pub is made of years of music and memories.
